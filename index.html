      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
  
      <p>
          <em>Blue Door Dungeon</em> is a refined, discreet sanctuary where authenticity meets artistry. Here, every whisper of leather, every shimmer of chain, and every breathless moment is held in sacred trust.
      </p>
  
      <p>
          We‚Äôre not just a dungeon‚Äîwe‚Äôre a destination for radical self-expression and sensual exploration. From your first step inside, you're wrapped in warmth, elegance, and a quiet intensity that invites you to go deeper.
      </p>
  
      <h3>üñ§ Our Core Principles</h3>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Consent Is Sacred:</strong> A continuous, enthusiastic agreement‚Äîvoiced, revisited, and respected.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety Is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Every toy inspected. Every scene supported. Every guest watched over with care.</li>
          <li><strong>Respect & Equality Above All:</strong> Roles are chosen; worth is inherent. Every guest is seen, heard, and honored.</li>
          <li><strong>Judgment-Free Exploration:</strong> No kink is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù when grounded in consent. This is your playground of truth.</li>
          <li><strong>Professionalism With Passion:</strong> Our team is trauma-informed, highly skilled, and deeply devoted to your experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Community & Connection:</strong> Events, mentorship, and mingling‚Äîno one journeys alone here.</li>
          <li><strong>Inclusive Sanctuary:</strong> Genderless. Label-less. Limitless. This space celebrates every identity, orientation, and desire.</li>
      </ol>
